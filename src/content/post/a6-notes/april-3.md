1. **Just ask people for what you want:** When you ask for something, people generally don't like saying no. Even if they can't fulfill your request, they'll often still offer some form of assistance.  

2. **Make notes, you won't regret it:** Notes are like your brain's sticky notesâ€”jot down what's important and stick to the point.  

3. **It's all in your head:** Your thoughts don't define you; they're just passing through. Stay mindful, observe them, but don't let them take control. Remember, you have the power to choose which thoughts to act on and which to let go.  

4. **You are what you consume:** The things you eat, read, watch, and listen to shape who you are, influencing your body, mind, and actions.
